# Multi-Agent Debate MCP Server

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@albinjal/multi-agent-debate-mcp)](https://smithery.ai/server/@albinjal/multi-agent-debate-mcp)

An MCP server implementation that enables structured multi-agent debates between different personas. This server allows multiple AI agents to engage in formal debates with arguments, rebuttals, and judgments across multiple rounds.

## Features

- Register multiple agents with different personas (e.g., "pro", "con", "judge")
- Structured debate flow with organized rounds
- Colorized console output with beautiful terminal display
- Flexible agent IDs beyond just "pro" and "con"
- Automatic verdict tracking with rationale
- Round-based system with configurable progression

## Tool

### multiagentdebate

Facilitates structured multi-agent debates with arguments, rebuttals, and judgments.

**Inputs:**
- `agentId` (string): Unique identifier for the agent (e.g., "pro", "con", "judge")
- `round` (integer): Current debate round number (â‰¥1)
- `action` (string): One of "register", "argue", "rebut", "judge"
- `content` (string, optional): The argument text or verdict content
- `targetAgentId` (string, optional): For rebuttals, specify which agent is being countered
- `needsMoreRounds` (boolean): Whether additional debate rounds are needed

## Usage

The Multi-Agent Debate tool is designed for:
- Structured debates between multiple AI personas
- Formal argumentation with rebuttals and counterpoints
- Multi-round discussions with judgment phases
- Complex decision-making processes requiring multiple perspectives
- Educational debate simulations
- Collaborative problem-solving through adversarial discussion

## Configuration

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

#### Local Development

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "multi-agent-debate": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/multi-agent-debate-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### npx

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "multi-agent-debate": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "multi-agent-debate-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Docker

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "multi-agent-debate": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "ghcr.io/albinjal/multi-agent-debate-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage with VS Code

For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`.

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> Note that the `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.

For local development:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "multi-agent-debate": {
        "command": "node",
        "args": [
          "path/to/multi-agent-debate-mcp/dist/index.js"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For npx installation:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "multi-agent-debate": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": [
          "-y",
          "multi-agent-debate-mcp"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For Docker installation:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "multi-agent-debate": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "--rm",
          "-i",
          "ghcr.io/albinjal/multi-agent-debate-mcp:latest"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
